Welcome to PLAN!

PLAN is a secure, visual communications and logistics planning tool for individuals and organizations.
It is intended to be an instrument of productivity, organization, and self-reliance.

PLAN is free and open-source (GPLv3), and each component and layer is "pluggable" an is offered as
an embodiment of an open-protocol.  The design principles of PLAN are similar and consistent with
Tim Berners-Lee's intention and design of http.

May PLAN empower organizations and individuals with little or no resources to communicate and self-organize 
intuitively and reliably.

## What's in This Repo?

This repo contains a directory and explanation of the layers, abstractions, and technologies that make it up. 
This information is intended for developer-types ready to understand and vet PLAN's architecture and design.  

Also in this repo is an engineering roadmap.


## PLAN: An Engineering Synopsis

PLAN isn't anything if it's not usable by non-technical users.  Yet, we know distributed systems, content-based
addressing, and cryptography are not human-relatable.  How do we square this circle?

IRC was a successfull entrierly flexible standard that served many -- including the military.  

PLAN is a p2p community-centric node operating layer, built on top of an open append-only and content-based addressing storage API, 
accessed by a real-time graphical client.
