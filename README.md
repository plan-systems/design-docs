## Welcome to PLAN!

[PLAN](http://plan.tools) is a multi-purpose communications and logistics planning tool for organizations and communities. PLAN is built on a “pluggable” architecture that integrates distributed services, encryption, and interoperable data-transport technologies — all inside a realtime visual interface. PLAN is an instrument for productivity, organization, and collaboration.

PLAN is free and open-source (GPLv3). The purpose of components in PLAN being pluggable is to allow anyone to easily add, improve, or extend component functionality. The design principles of PLAN are focused on making information transport and delivery openly interoperable and extensible, similar to how Tim Berners-Lee's HTTP sought to make information browsing interoperable.

We also wish to acknowledge the principles surrounding [multistream](https://github.com/multiformats/multistream) by [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai), which subtly but decisively improves how protocols, paths, and formats can be expressed as to invite interoperability; `http://` becomes `/http/`.

May PLAN empower organizations and individuals with little or no resources to intuitively, securely, and reliably communicate and self-organize.

## What's in This Repo?

This repo presents and discusses the layers, abstractions, and technologies that comprise PLAN.  It is written for technical-types ready to understand and vet PLAN's architecture and design.  A formal [Proof of Correctness](proof-of-correctness.md) for PLAN is also available for review.
